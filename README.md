# CS2043_TeamProject

Repository for the CS2043 team project.The project is to design and build a software tool which will help school administrators keep track and assign on-calls to classes that need coverage.

### Description
This is a On-Call Tracker software system built for CS2043 Software Engineering project at the University of New Brunswick.

### System Considerations:
*For input and outputs excel, older excel formats must be used (i.e. xls). The system won't accept newer versions of excel (i.e. xlsx)

*A user of the system must have the right dependencies files

*Input files must be entered in the right order

*Selected dates must already exist in the input excel files
