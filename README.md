# CS2043_Team Project Deliverable 4 

Repository for the CS2043 team project.The project is to design and build a software tool will be built in order to help school administrators to keep track and assign on-calls to classes that need coverage.

### Description
This is a On-Call Tracker software system built for CS2043 Software Engineering project at the University of New Brunswick.

### System Considerations:
* For input and outputs excel, older excel formats must be used (i.e. xls). The system won't accept newer versions of excel (i.e. xlsx)

* A user of the system must have the right dependencies files

* Input files must be entered in the right order :octocat: 

* Selected dates must already exist in the input excel files

### For testing

|    **INPUT**        | **OUTPUT**              |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| AbsenceWorkbook.xls | AbsenceWorkbook.xls  |
| TallyWorkbook.xls   | TallyWorkbook.xls  |


* Data is overwritten so tester must go back into excel files and re-enter values or use a back up version.
* In the absence tracker 0 must be filled where there are no absences. 0 must be used as the default value for empty fields.
